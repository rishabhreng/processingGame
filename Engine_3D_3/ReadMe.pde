Face
  A face is what is actually graphed and is always a triangle because a triangle determines a plane.
  Each face has a variable which contains its "parent" object of which it is a part.
  The faces also have arrays which contain three numbers which refer to the vertices of the object being graphed through the array of point objects. These numbers are used to access the points after transformed versions have been made.
